Lost your password?

This e-mail is sent to you because someone (hopefully yourself) requested your password to be reset at resourcetracking.heroku.com

If you did not request this, you may safely disregard this message - your password has not been changed yet, and no harm has come from it!

To change your password, follow this link: <%= link_to 'Change my password', edit_password_url(@resource, :reset_password_token => @resource.reset_password_token) %>

This will present you with a form at which you can change your password.

<%= render 'notifier/signature' %>
